#The Best Food Places in Times Square
---
##What is this?
This is a single page app that uses both the Google Maps API and Fouresquare's Venue API to list all of the places to grab some good grub around the Times Square Area. This project was written in order to fulfill the requirements for Udacity's FEND scholarship.

##How to run the App
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine before attempting to run this App. Next CD into the directory containing the app. There are a few dependencies:
1.) npm install

3.) npm install --save react-geocode
4.) npm install --save escape-string-regexp
5.) npm install --save react-google-maps

##Outside Sources
In order to sinish this project I needed to use the FoureSquare API for Places and as well as making an XMLHttpRequest from https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_http.asp

I have removed the API Key, you will need to insert one into the code in the App.js file on the last line that reads YOUR_API_KEY
After this run the NPM Start and the App should open in the default browser
Thank you and enjoy =]
