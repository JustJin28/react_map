#The Best Food Places in Times Square
---
##What is this?
This is a single page app that uses both the Google Maps API and Fouresquare's Venue API to list all of the places to grab some good grub around the Times Square Area. This project was written in order to fulfill the requirements for Udacity's FEND scholarship.
